# GenZen

A personal workspace for working with AI image models.

## Up next

The open issues labelled [`now`](https://github.com/joshcoolman/genzen/labels/now),
then [`next`](https://github.com/joshcoolman/genzen/labels/next). The labels are
the ranking; a list here would be a second copy of it that drifts.

## Run it locally

You need Docker, pnpm, and **Node 22.13+**. No cloud account is required
anywhere — Postgres, auth and storage all run as local containers.

The Node floor is not cosmetic: `packageManager` pins pnpm 11, which imports
`node:sqlite` and cannot run on Node 20. Corepack fetches pnpm before anything
reads `engines`, so an older Node fails during `pnpm install` with
`ERR_UNKNOWN_BUILTIN_MODULE: node:sqlite` and no mention of your Node version.

A `FAL_KEY` is optional to start — the app runs without one and only image
generation fails. Supplying one means generations bill your fal.ai account;
nothing is mocked.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm local:up                  # asks for your FAL key, sets up everything else
pnpm dev                       # http://localhost:3000
```

That is the whole setup — there is no global CLI to install and no env file to
copy or edit. `local:up`
starts Postgres and MinIO (S3-compatible storage) from `docker-compose.yml`,
writes `.env.local` for you, applies any migrations the database has not seen,
generates and provisions a login, and prompts for the FAL key. Re-run it any
time: it is idempotent, it keeps your key, and it never resets a database you
have been working in. `pnpm local:reset` is the deliberate way to start over.

| Thing         | Where                                               |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| App           | http://localhost:3000                               |
| Sign in as    | printed by `local:up`, kept in `.env.local`         |
| MinIO console | http://localhost:9011 (`genzenlocal`/`genzenlocal`) |
| Postgres      | `postgres://genzen:genzen@localhost:5434/genzen`    |

There is no shipped account. `local:up` generates a password on first run,
creates the user, and prints the login; it lands in `.env.local` as
`LOCAL_DEV_EMAIL` / `LOCAL_DEV_PASSWORD`. Edit either one and re-run to change
it — the file is the source of truth and the password is re-synced from it,
which is also the whole password-reset story. `pnpm users` manages accounts on a
deployed instance — list, add, delete — and takes `--local` to work on the
docker stack instead.

FAL is not mocked — generation calls fal.ai for real and costs real money. The
app boots and everything else works without a key. Every generation's cost lands
in the Activity log.

Ports: MinIO is on 9010/9011 rather than its default 9000/9001, so this stack
can run alongside `~/repos/bootsy`.

If a shell-exported `FAL_KEY` shadows the one in `.env.local`, `local:up` warns
about it — that's the usual reason generation 401s.

## Repo map

Checked by `src/lib/repo-map.test.ts` — a path named here that does not exist
fails the build.

| `src/features/<name>/` | Domain modules. **Each has its own `CLAUDE.md` — read it before editing the feature.**    |
| `src/lib/server/`      | `.server.ts` = never client-importable; `.action.ts` = a `'use server'` module.           |

## Env

**Locally there is nothing to configure.** `pnpm local:up` writes `.env.local`
itself and prompts you for the one value that is actually yours, the FAL key.

`.env.example` is the reference for deploying, split into Required (a Postgres
URL, a session secret, FAL, an S3 bucket) and Optional (Anthropic, FAL
webhooks). [`docs/deploying.md`](docs/deploying.md) covers the rest: what a
deployment needs, the two non-default settings, and how the first user is made.

The `R2_*` names are historical and are staying that way (#242). The storage
layer is plain S3 pointing wherever `R2_ENDPOINT` says — MinIO locally, a
Railway bucket in production, Cloudflare R2 nowhere. **The bucket must be
private** (#226); the app serves images itself. `R2_ACCOUNT_ID` derives
Cloudflare's endpoint and is unused.

Provider keys are server-only. Only `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` reaches the browser — Next
inlines nothing else, and the `VITE_` prefix carries no meaning here (#225).

## Conventions / gotchas

- Route protection is deny-by-default in `proxy.ts` — a new public path must be listed in its `PUBLIC_PATHS`.
- No Tailwind and no CSS framework. `src/styles/tokens.css` is the token layer,
  `src/styles/base.css` the reset; everything else is a `.module.css` beside its
  component. `src/styles.css` imports those two and nothing else. Colors live
  in `tokens.css` alone — `pnpm check:colors` enforces it (#229).
- `.server.ts` must never be imported from client code; `.action.ts` is a `'use server'` module meant to be. Lint enforces the split (#241).
- FAL generation status is reconciled via on-demand polling in `src/lib/server/check-pending-generations.action.ts`. Webhooks are optional and gated by env.
- The bucket is private, so there are no public object URLs to persist. Images
  are served by the app at `/img/[id]`, which resolves identity from the cookie
  and filters the row by `user_id`. `src/lib/image-url.ts` is the only place a
  URL is built, and it returns an app path, never a storage key (#226).
- Every generate path reserves its `user_images` row _before_ any fallible work,
  so a click always leaves a card behind — pending, completed, or failed with a
  reason and a Retry.

## Last shipped

- **One field fill, one row hover** — the tinted background on the aspect and model fields was hand-written in five modules (one in `srgb` while the rest were `oklab`) and missing from the controls beside them. It is `--field`/`--field-hover` now, across every form control. Menu and option rows got `--row-hover`, a wash of light: they had all been hovering to `--surface-raised` while sitting on `--surface`, a five-point step that registered as nothing (#346)
- **The generator panel got its rhythm** — Instructions became a gear on the header, the dock's X went (the sidebar toggles it, and an X on a panel that survives closing reads as "discard"), Generate prompt moved down beside Add prompt to split that row evenly, and the "Reference images" heading went. Every vertical gap in the column now reads one `--panel-rhythm` knob instead of the 12/8/4 three components had each picked alone (#345)
- **Menus took the model list's density** — the thumb and group menus were drawing 14px rows with 16px icons next to a model picker drawing the same kind of row at 12px; both are picker lines and now draw alike, canvas's context menu included. The audit behind it found the token scale is healthy (21 raw declarations, 13 of them in canvas) and what is missing is role naming — which token a picker row vs. body vs. metadata gets (#343, follow-up #344)
- **Permissive in, informed after** — the generator panel no longer caps the reference strip at the smallest selected model, which used to _delete_ staged images when you ticked a one-image model. Stage as many as you like; each model takes what its endpoint holds, the submit drops the rest, and the card says "1 of 5 images". The picker became a table (name, price, capacity) sorted by price, with rows that cannot hold the current set dimmed but still selectable (#341)
- **A cheap tier, three models wide** — Z-Image Turbo, FLUX.2 Flash and FLUX.2 Klein 4B, half a cent to a cent each. Everything else in the lineup was $0.03–$0.04, or $1.00 for GPT Image 2, so there was no tier for "fire several and skim". Three because the picker is multi-select: the same prompt across all three costs under two cents (#262)
- **Group writes are one round trip** — filing images into a group moves the grid on the click, and the card's new cover and count arrive with the response. Every group write returns what it changed (the affected summaries, the images whose membership moved, the ids a group trash soft-deleted) instead of being followed by a group re-read and a gallery re-read, serialised, with nothing on screen moving until the last landed (#331)
